# Fruit recognition using Python and Flask

This project is a web application that recognizes fruits/vegetables.

# Data

Fruit images dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition). Dataset contains images of the following food items:

- Fruits:
  banana, apple, pear, grapes, orange, kiwi, watermelon, pomegranate, pineapple, mango

- Vegetables:
  cucumber, carrot, onion, potato, lemon, tomato, raddish, beetroot, cabbage, lettuce, spinach, soy bean, cauliflower, pepper, chilli pepper, turnip, corn, sweetcorn, sweet potato, jalepe√±o, ginger, garlic, peas, eggplant



## Features

- Detects the fruits in an image based on a provided URL.
- `fruit_recognition_model.ipynb` is the notebook file of the training
- `fruit_recognition_test.ipynb` is the notebook file in which the model is tested on a set from `images` folder
- `process_model.py` is a python file containing image processing, which will be loaded from a URL.
- `app.py`  is a python file, used to run Flask application.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (Web framework)
- tensorflow
- keras
- HTML/CSS
